This Github forum is developing a human-centric data model suitable for trial use and further development by a Standards Developing Organization (SDO). 

This work is chartered as a Thematic Group of MyData Global (mydata.org).  See approved charter at  bit.ly/3nKOGwz.

This initiative came from the MyData.org Slack channel at: mydataglobal.slack.com (need to join MyData first) #standard-personal-data-model, which developed a technical paper posted at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PSEtsaTvhgvnU2vyC2zqPKgZmk7LfwMFe1B5y6e4yqY/edit 

This forum welcomes alternative solutions for an SPDM, or forking of those posted here (per license of each).  A separate repo may be set up by anyone for each initiative.  At this time, the PDM-Glossary is posted here and is in development.  MyData Dictionary at https://dictionary.mydata.org/ is invited to create a repo.  Other components and contributions are also posted.
