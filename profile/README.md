This project will develop a person-centric data model suitable for standardization by a Standards Developing Organization (SDO). 

This project is being proposed as a Thematic Group of MyData Global (mydata.org).  See draft proposed charter at  bit.ly/3nKOGwz.

This open source project came, in part, from the MyData.org Slack channel at: mydataglobal.slack.com (need to join MyData first) #standard-personal-data-model, which developed a technical paper posted at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PSEtsaTvhgvnU2vyC2zqPKgZmk7LfwMFe1B5y6e4yqY/edit
