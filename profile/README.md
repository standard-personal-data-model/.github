This project is developing a person-centric data model suitable for standardization by a Standards Developing Organization (SDO). 

This work may soon be sponsored as a Thematic Group of MyData Global (mydata.org).  See draft proposed charter at  bit.ly/3nKOGwz.

This open source project came from the MyData.org Slack channel at: mydataglobal.slack.com (need to join MyData first) #standard-personal-data-model, which developed a technical paper posted at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PSEtsaTvhgvnU2vyC2zqPKgZmk7LfwMFe1B5y6e4yqY/edit

A pilot is in the planning that will provide requirements for this SPDM plus early implementations of some of the components of this ecosystem.  

This project welcomes all proposed versions of an SPDM, or forking of those posted here (per license of each).  A separate repo is set up for each.  At this time, the PDM-Glossary is posted and in development.  MyData Dictionary at https://dictionary.mydata.org/ is also invited to create a repo.
